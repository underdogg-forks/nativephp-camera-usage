# NativePHP UI Kitchen Sink

A showcase app for [NativePHP Mobile](https://nativephp.com) — fully native UI rendered from PHP using Blade templates, Tailwind classes, and Yoga layout. No JavaScript frameworks, no WebViews.

> **Not for production.** This is a reference app for exploring NativePHP's Element rendering system.

## What's Inside
